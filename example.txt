Introduction to DevOps

DevOps is a methodology that integrates software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to streamline workflows and enhance software delivery. It promotes automation, continuous integration, and collaboration among teams.

Key DevOps practices include:

Automation of infrastructure, testing, and deployments
CI/CD Pipelines to enable frequent code integration and deployment
Monitoring & Logging for better system observability
Security (DevSecOps) to integrate security in the development lifecycle
Popular DevOps tools include Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and Prometheus. Implementing DevOps leads to faster releases, improved efficiency, and greater reliability.
